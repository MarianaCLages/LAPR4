=======================================

# 1. Requisitos

As Project Manager, I intend that, for demonstration purposes, the system has the possibility of being initialized (bootstrap)
with some information related to the product catalog and auxiliary information (e.g., categories of products).

# 2. Observações

Since this User Story is about adding information to the bootstrap, there was no need for diagrams, additional implementation or testing.
