## **Demo:**

As Project Manager, I want that the "AGVManager" component is enhanced with a basic FIFO algorithm to automatically assign tasks to AGVs.

## Acceptance Criteria:

* It must be used the provided application protocol (SPOMS2022).

* The dashboard is intended to be displayed on a web page provided by an existing HTTP server in the "BackOfficeApp" application and only available to localhost.

* The dashboard web page is kept updated without reloading.

## Client Answers:

**Question 1:** Despite in the provided sprint user stories asking for the digital twin in a web dashboard along with its status and position, 
in user stories of the next sprint it is said that the development of the movement of the AGV is needed which causes a minor confusion. 
My question is in this sprint is it required to create the movement of the AGV?

**A1:** On Sprint C, the web dashboard needs to be thought and ready to show the current AGVs position, which is read from some where. Further, on sprint D, when simulating the AGV movement the AGV position will change and, therefore, we will be able to see the AGVs position changing accordingly on the web dashboard.

Notice that, this is an integrative project developed following an iterative and incremental process. So, at the end, the pieces need to fit well together.

**Question 2:** How would you like the dashboard to look? A simple list of the AGVS along with its position and status?

**A2:** No! Preferably, the dashboard should be an approximation to what is depicted on Figure 8 of the specifications document.

## 
#Analysis

A **HTTP Server** must generate the **Warehouse Plant** and the client must connect it to be able to see it.

The **HTTP Server** must access the Repository to be able to get the **Warehouse**.

The **HTTP Server** must always update the **Dashboard Web**.

###Functionality Realization

We are using a layer structure design:

* Server:
    * Presentation:
        * DemoConsumer
        * HttpServerAjaxVoting
    * Thread:
        * HttpAjaxVotingRequest
* Domain:
    * Warehouse
    * AGV
* Persistance
    * WarehouseRepository
    * PersistenceContext
    * RepositoryFactory
    * WarehouseRepository

## Applied Techniques

* GRASI (Information Expert, Creator, Controller, Low Coupling (evaluative), High Cohesion (evaluative), Polymorphism, Pure Fabrication, Indirection, Protected Variations);
    + Information Expert - The service, since has a direct connection with the repositories, in this case, knows all domain concepts from this specific Use Case;
    + Creator, the UI creates the controller, and the controller creates all needed services;
    + Low Coupling and High Cohesion, since we are using a lot of structured layers, all with a specific meaning, we are applying this pattern aswell;
    + Polymorphism, since a domain concept object may have multiple different values;
    + Pure Fabrication, since there is only 1 of each type of class created, meaning, in case of the controller and the UI they are only created one time;
    + The other patterns already were explained by previous points;
* Tell, don't ask;
    + Basic pattern, has a similar function as "Keep it simple", since both patterns apply simple interaction between actor - UI and UI - controller;
* Single Responsibility Principle;
* Interface Segregation Principle;
* Intention Revealing Interfaces;
* DDD (Persistence Ignorance, Entity, Value Object, Domain Service, Aggregate, Domain Event, Observer, Events);
    + This pattern was introduced in EAPLI, where we started working with this pattern. It is very important to fully understand this pattern, since it makes an implementation of a domain business concept way easier (and makes it easier to understand to outside people), Entities, value objects, services... All are well explained in the Geral Domain model and the glossary, so I think there is no need to explain this here;
* Repositories pattern;
    + This pattern applies a persistance context using repositories to have an easier communication between the run time system, and a remote database, where it makes the operation between the same atomic and simple transactions;
* Services pattern;
    + This pattern applies both to the domain and the application layer, in this specific Use Case it wasn't used services in the domain layer only in the Application layer, as stated previously to make an easier interaction between CONTROLLER - SERVICE - REPOSITORY;
