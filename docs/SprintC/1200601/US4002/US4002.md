US 4002
=======================================

## **Demo:**

As Project Manager, I want that the "AGVManager" component is enhanced with a basic FIFO algorithm to automatically assign tasks to AGVs.

## Acceptance Criteria:

* The general idea is that product orders reaching a certain state whose meaning is of "need to be prepared by an AGV" are added to a list. Then, following the FIFO algorithm orders are removed from the queue and assigned to available AGVs capable of performing the task that such order implies.
* Teams are free to propose a solution for that problem/issue. Notice that all team decisions must be well supported in light of business need and technical constraints.

## Client Answers:

* In US4002 it is required that the AGV Manager should support automatic assignment of orders to AGVs. In US2003 the Warehouse Employee will be able to assign any order to an AGV available. If the orders are being automatically assigned to an AGV (US4002)


#Analysis

The AGV Managager server should automatically associate **Orders** that are ready to be processed by **AGV**
and search for a free **AGV** by prioritizing the **FIFO** algorithm.

Each **Order** can only be associated with only one **AGV**, after an **AGV** is assigned
to an **Order** it can no longer process any other **Order** until it has completed processing
its current **Order**.

In this User Story, the user has no participation with the program. 

The **AGV Twin** must interact with the server and request it orders to be assigned.

## Domain Model

##Design

###General Scenario

The **FIFO** algorithm in the server will always be waiting for new available **AGVs** ready to process new **Orders**, the same
happens when there are no **Orders** to be processed, the **FIFO** will wait for new **Orders**. For this waiting mechanism, our team
decided to use **Semaphores**. 

In the **AGV Manager** server there are two **Semaphores** implemmented: the **agvSemaphore** and the **orderSemaphore**, which will
control the **Order** and the **AGV** flow.

The **REQUESTS_API_RequestFactory** is responsible to build all the requests implemmented in the server.

When the **AGV Manager** server finds a new **Order** to be processed, the class **WARN_SERVER_NEW_ORDER** will add the new **Order**
to the **OrderList**. And then, whenever there is an available **AGV**. 

Each **AGVTwin** will be a Thread, which will inform the server that is free to receive a new task from it. Each time there is a new
**AGVTwin** ready for a task,  the **FIFO** algorithm.

The class **REQUEST_ASSIGN_ORDER_Request** will be responsible
to assign that **AGV** to the **Order**.




###Functionality Realization

We are using a layer structure design:

* AGVTwin:
  * Domain:
    * AGVTwinThread
  * TwinClient
  * EstablishConnectionService 

* AGV Manager Server:
    * Presentation:
        * TcpAgvProtocolServer
        * TcpAgvSrv
    * Domain:
        * AGV_Request_ORDER
        * FifoAGVTwin
        * REQUEST_ASSIGN_ORDER_Request
        * REQUESTS_API_Request
        * REQUESTS_API_RequestFactory
        * TcpAGVSrvThread
        * WARN_SERVER_NEW_ORDER
* Domain:
    * ClientOrder
    * AGV
* Persistance
    * OrderRepository
    * JPAOrderRepository
    * AGVRepository
    * JPAAGVRepository

## Applied Techniques

* GRASI (Information Expert, Creator, Controller, Low Coupling (evaluative), High Cohesion (evaluative), Polymorphism, Pure Fabrication, Indirection, Protected Variations);
    + Information Expert - The service, since has a direct connection with the repositories, in this case, knows all domain concepts from this specific Use Case;
    + Creator, the UI creates the controller, and the controller creates all needed services;
    + Low Coupling and High Cohesion, since we are using a lot of structured layers, all with a specific meaning, we are applying this pattern aswell;
    + Polymorphism, since a domain concept object may have multiple different values;
    + Pure Fabrication, since there is only 1 of each type of class created, meaning, in case of the controller and the UI they are only created one time;
    + The other patterns already were explained by previous points;
* Tell, don't ask;
    + Basic pattern, has a similar function as "Keep it simple", since both patterns apply simple interaction between actor - UI and UI - controller;
* Single Responsibility Principle;
* Interface Segregation Principle;
* Intention Revealing Interfaces;
* DDD (Persistence Ignorance, Entity, Value Object, Domain Service, Aggregate, Domain Event, Observer, Events);
    + This pattern was introduced in EAPLI, where we started working with this pattern. It is very important to fully understand this pattern, since it makes an implementation of a domain business concept way easier (and makes it easier to understand to outside people), Entities, value objects, services... All are well explained in the Geral Domain model and the glossary, so I think there is no need to explain this here;
* Repositories pattern;
    + This pattern applies a persistance context using repositories to have an easier communication between the run time system, and a remote database, where it makes the operation between the same atomic and simple transactions;
* Services pattern;
    + This pattern applies both to the domain and the application layer, in this specific Use Case it wasn't used services in the domain layer only in the Application layer, as stated previously to make an easier interaction between CONTROLLER - SERVICE - REPOSITORY;

## Tests

###Test 1: Smoke Test, testing the AGV Manager Connection.

    private static final Logger LOGGER = LogManager.getLogger(TwinClient.class);


    public static void tcpEstablishTeste() {
        AGVRepository agvRepository = PersistenceContext.repositories().agvRepository();

        String dns = Application.settings().getTcpAgvManagerServerDns()
        int sock = Integer.parseInt(Application.settings().getTcpAgvManagerClientSocketPort());

        Iterable<AGV> agvList = agvRepository.findAll();
        int serverPort = Integer.parseInt(Application.settings().getTcpTwinServerSocketPort());

        for (AGV agv : agvList) {
            Thread t = new AGVTwinThread(agv, sockNum, dns, serverPort);
            t.start();
            serverPort--;
        }

    }
    }

# 4. Implementation

Since the requirements of this Use Case was to be able to implement a basic FIFO, we implemented patterns which allowed us to make this feature way simpler and completed. This way we can abstract the Controller, Application Layer, from the Repository Layer, thus applying the Grap Pattern the best as we can (Since the only module that is going to use the database API is the application servers module).

# 5. Integration/Demonstration

We implemmented a EstablishConnection class on the AGVTwin module, each time we connect
to the server, it will automatically assing Order to the Available AGVs.


# 6. Observations

I think our interpretation of the Use Case was the best as possible, since we added the option to run this TCP Server in the cloud, which was extra.
