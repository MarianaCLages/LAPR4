# US3501
=======================================

# 1. Requisitos

**US:** As Customer, I want to get the list of questionnaires that the system is asking me to answer and be able to
answer any of those questionnaires.

- **AC1:** The UI should be generated dynamically in accordance to the given questionnaire. I.e. que UI is generated by
  interpreting the input questionnaire.

- **AC2:** The answers should be saved in a raw text format to be further processed/analyzed.

This US contains 2 use cases they are:

- **UC 3.3.2:** View notifications to answer a survey/questionnaire. Customers should be able to get a list of all
  the notifications received to answer a given survey. A customer receives a notification when (s)he meets the target
  audience of a given survey.

- **UC 3.3.3:** Answer a survey/questionnaire. Following a received notification, customers answer the questions of the
  requested questionnaire.

## Questions

> **Question:**
> Dear client,
> Question 1: In regard to the survey rules, can a survey have multiple of them?
>
> Question 2: If multiple rules were chosen for a given survey, would these be used in conjunction or disjunction?
>
>Example: "Having ordered a certain product and be of a certain gender" or "Having ordered a certain product or be of a
> certain gender"
>
> **Answer:**
> Q1 and Q2: It would be nice to specify more than one condition in the same rule and have more than one rule.
>
>Example:
>
>Rule 1 (two conditions): "Having ordered a certain product (C1) and be of a certain gender (C2)".
>
>Rule 2 (one condition): "Living in Porto district".
>
>The target customers would be the ones meeting Rule 1 or Rule 2.
>
>So, you have conjunction inside a rule (C1 and C2) and disjunction between rules (R1 or R2).
>
>At the end of Sprint D, at least one scenario (conjunction or disjunction) must be supported.

# 2. Análise

Analising the requirements, we can see that the user story has 3 core features:

- There is the need of notifiate the user when a survey is available to answer.
- There is the need of answer a survey.
- There is the need of save the answers of the survey in a raw text format.

### Domain Model

![DomainModel](C:\Users\eduar\Desktop\ProjetoIntegrador\lei21_22_s4_2dj_1\Docs\SprintD\1200920\US3501\DM.svg)

In this excerpt we can see that there is the interation between the Customer and the Survey. The survey is directed to a
specific type of customer. The customer is the one that is going to answer the survey.

### System Sequence Diagram

#### Customer Receives a Notification

![SystemSequenceDiagram](C:\Users\eduar\Desktop\ProjetoIntegrador\lei21_22_s4_2dj_1\Docs\SprintD\1200920\US3501\SSD_CustomerReceivesANotification.svg)

#### Customer checks the list of unanswered surveys

![SystemSequenceDiagram](C:\Users\eduar\Desktop\ProjetoIntegrador\lei21_22_s4_2dj_1\Docs\SprintD\1200920\US3501\SSD_CustomerChecksTheListOfUnansweredSurveys.svg)

As we can see, the customer receives a notification when a survey is available to answer. The customer checks the list
of surveys that are available to answer.
Then, in order to answer a survey, there is a loop that iterates over all the questions.

After discussing with the team, we decided:

- The struture of the output file:
  <br>
  TYPE;QUESTION;OPTIONS \n

  ANSWER

  <br>

- The directory where the output file is saved:
    - IdSurvey
        - The filename:
            - Survey[IdSurvey]_[IdCustomer].txt

# 4. Integração/Demonstração

There were the need of implementing a notification system to notify the user when a survey is available to answer, so
there were modifications in US3001. When the creation of the survey is done, the system should send a notification to
the users that are in the target audience of the survey.

Also, there were the need to update the US3001 since the past implementation didn't fulfill fully the requirements.

The answers of the survey should be saved in a raw text format to be further created statistics about the answers in the
US 3002 (UC 3.3.4).

# 6. Observações

The notification system is not working properly. Right now, the system is not sending the notification to the users. In
order to have a working system, we mocked it, right now the system is seraching for surveys whose target audience is
the same as the user when the user ask to se his notifications.
