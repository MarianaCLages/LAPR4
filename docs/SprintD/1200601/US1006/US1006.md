### Sales Clerk Manual Customer Creation

* Information Expert
* Tell, don't ask
* Single Responsibility Principle
* Interface Segregation Principle
* DDD (Persistence Ignorance, Entity, Value Object, Domain Service, Aggregate, Domain Event, Observer)
* Repositories were used.
* GRASP (High cohesion, Low coupling)
* For this project we will maintain the UI-Controller interaction, the UI will interact with the user, requesting
  information about the object eapli.base.customermanagement.domain.Customer which will then be sent to the Controller.
* The Controller will call the Services that are responsible for the Customer creation.
* The CustomerRepository class will be responsible to add the object into the database.
* A Customer Builder was implemented which is reponsible for building the Customer object.
